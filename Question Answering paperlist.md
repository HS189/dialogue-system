    Challenges: 

    1. the task of supporting passage selection for factoid QA may be largely cast as a textual entailment problem

    2. the linguistic similarities between questions and answers may or may not be
       indicative for our task. 

       This is because, depending on what the question is looking for, a good answer may come in different forms: 

       sometimes a correct answer completes the question precisely with the missing information, and in other scenarios, good answers need to elaborate part of the question to rationalize it, and so on. 

       Additionally, while a good answer must relate to the question, they often do
       not share common lexical units.

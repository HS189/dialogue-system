+ knowledge graph

  Lucene

  1. topic identification (contextual user query)

  2. query expansion (using knowledge graph (KG) retrieve up to n most related topics, These topics are scored by their relevance using a boosted tree ranker[1] trained on manually labeled training data.)

  3. form a query by combines the query topics and their related topics to retrieve from document (sentences) as response candidates.

  Advantage: the generation-based offers robustness and high coverage

##### response candidate ranking

+ a ranking score based on four categories of features:

  Local cohesion features (DSSMs)

  Global coherence features (DSSMs)

  Empathy matching features

  Retrieval matching features (word level, such as BM25 and TFIDF scores, semantic level, such as DSSM scores)

To evaluate the effectiveness of XiaoIce as an AI companion to human users with emotional connections, we use the metric of CPS which indicates on average usersâ€™ willingness to share time with XiaoIce via conversation.

Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS) as the success metric for social chatbots. It is the average number of conversation-turns between the chatbot and the user in a conversational session. The larger the CPS is, the better engaged the social chatbot is.
